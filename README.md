# godot-intro-tutorials

This repository contains the [introductory projects](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/index.html) presented in the official Godot documentation with minor modifications. The projects do not run collectively as one Godot project (for now), each folder contains its own `project.godot` file. For further explainations and details of modifications, see the README file in each folder.
